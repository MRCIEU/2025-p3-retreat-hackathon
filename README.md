  - Intro to the hackathon
  - Random allocation of people to teams and projects
  - Swap: a person in a team can swap with another person in another team, as long as the two people agree to swap
  - Project to work on
    - We have curated some datasets for teams to work on
    - The team could either work on the allocated dataset, 
      - or come up with their own problem / dataset to work on if there is a consensus among team member
  - When the teams finish their allocation decisions, Yi will take a record. Yi will then create protected branches in this repo and for people to commit their code to (if they want).
